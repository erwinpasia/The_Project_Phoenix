# The_Project_Phoenix
This portfolio represents my consolidated Professional Credentials and Capstone Projects. During the global mid/post-COVID shift, I launched “Project Phoenix” a mission to transform my skillset and evolve into an Applied AI Engineer and E2E Data Science Professional, with the ultimate goal of laying the foundation for future Tech Entrepreneurship.
